# Natie AI Docs

Natie AI is a self-hostable personal assistant platform built as a TypeScript monorepo.
It combines a Next.js web app with a Fastify API that runs agent workflows for chat, Gmail, X (Twitter), and Telegram.

Use this documentation to install the project, configure integrations, and understand how the repository is structured.

## What you can do with Natie

- Chat with Natie about your inbox, X (Twitter), and Telegram.
- Connect Gmail using OAuth.
- Connect X (Twitter) using your `auth_token` and `ct0` credentials.
- Use Telegram gateway support (optional bot token) to chat with Natie from Telegram.
- Explore API docs at `/docs` and consume generated clients via Orval.

## Start here

1. Follow the [Setup](/setup) guide to run the app locally.
2. Continue to [Configure](/configure) to enable Gmail, Telegram, and WorkOS integrations.

## Repository at a glance

- `packages/*`: shared libraries and generated clients.

## Need help?

If you are setting this up for the first time, complete the setup guide first, then configure each integration one by one.
